# 🛠️ Marketplace Builder Hackathon - Day 2
Welcome to Day 2 of my incredible journey in the Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025! 🎉 Today’s focus was on crafting a solid system design and outlining the integration of frontend, backend, and external services for a seamless user experience.

## 🛠️ Key Highlights of the System Design
The architecture is tailored for scalability, efficiency, and an intuitive user flow. Here's a snapshot of the planned setup:

## 🎯 Frontend and Backend Coordination
### Frontend Framework:
Built using Next.js with a modern UI styled via Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components.

### Backend Setup:
Leveraging Sanity.io as the CMS to manage content dynamically and provide robust API endpoints.

### Communication Protocol:
The frontend communicates with the backend via standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

## 🌐 External API Integration Plan
To enhance functionality, external APIs will handle key features such as:

### Purpose:
Managing payment transactions and real-time product availability updates.

#### Integration Approach:
The frontend sends structured requests to the backend, which interacts with external APIs to retrieve or process data.

#### Security Framework:
End-to-end data communication is secured using HTTPS and authentication through API keys.

## 📊 Defined Endpoints for APIs
Here are the major API routes shaping the system's functionality:

GET /api/products: Retrieves the product catalog.
POST /api/order: Initiates order creation and starts payment processing.
GET /api/order/:id: Fetches details of a specific order.
PUT /api/order/:id: Updates order status (e.g., shipped, delivered).
GET /api/payment/verify: Confirms payment status with the third-party API.
Additional endpoints will address features like advanced payment processing and inventory synchronization.

## 💡 Tech Stack Overview
Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS,CSS.
Backend: Sanity.io
Third-Party APIs: Payment handling and product availability
Authentication: Clerk Authentication for secure logins and transactions

## 📃 Data Flow Overview
The planned data flow ensures clear communication across all components:

Frontend: Sends user actions and requests to the backend via API routes.
Backend: Processes these requests, interacts with external APIs, and sends back responses.

## 📊 Visual Schema for Data Entities
The schema for entities such as products, orders, and payments is meticulously crafted for scalability and performance. A detailed Data Schema Diagram is available to showcase the structure visually.

## 🚀 Day 2 Summary
Day 2 has been a major milestone! I’ve successfully outlined the system architecture and integration strategies for frontend-backend communication and external APIs. With a strong foundation in place, I’m excited to begin building the marketplace!
